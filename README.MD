The radio channel updater is used to batch-update all FF-modules UHF AM & VHF FM channel frequencies, to use a common channel list.
The mission-file from your dcs .miz-file must be extracted, and placed in the same folder as the channel updater. The updater then creates a new mission-file with the updated frequencies. This new mission-file is ready to be placed in your .miz file.

At this stage, channel 1 is overridden from the units frequency-field in the ME, and I have not found a workaround so far. This frequency-field must be manually adjusted to your new channel 1 manually within ME.
